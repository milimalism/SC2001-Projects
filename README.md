# SC2001-Projects

We had 3 projects that we had to present during our labs: 

Project 1 : Analysing a merge-intesertion hybrid sorting algorithm to find the optimal length of input array at which we must shift from meger to insertion sort.

Project 2 : Analysing two forms of dijkstra's algorithm: 

             1st: using a priority queue to store vertices and adjecency matrix to store the graph
             
             2nd: using a minimising heap to store vertices and adjecency list to store the graph
             
Project 3 : Coming up with an algorithm to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem where unlimited versions of the same object are available.
